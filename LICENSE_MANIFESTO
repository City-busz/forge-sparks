All knowledge arises from a common experience, and each individual development is the synthesis of different, often invisible, collective contributions. This work would not have been possible without all the experience accumulated by humanity until today; therefore, this work belongs to humanity.

Don't worry, it's not stealing. Stealing is intellectual property.

You can keep the attribution to the author if you like. Attribution can help other people find the sources to contribute to them or use them for their own developments. But this is an ethical issue, not an obligation.
