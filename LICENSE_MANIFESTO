All knowledge arises from a common experience, and each individual development is the synthesis of different collective contributions that are often invisible. This work would not have been possible without all the experience accumulated by humanity to this day; therefore, this work belongs to humanity.

Don't worry, it's not stealing. Theft is intellectual property.

You can keep the attribution to the author if you feel like it. Attribution can help other people find sources to contribute to or use for their own development. But this is an ethical issue, not an obligation.
